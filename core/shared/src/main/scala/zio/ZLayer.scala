/**
 * A `ZLayer[A, E, B]` describes a layer of an application: every layer in an
 * application requires some services (the input) and produces some services
 * (the output).
 *
 * Layers can be thought of as recipes for producing bundles of services, given
 * their dependencies (other services).
 *
 * Construction of layers can be effectful and utilize resources that must be
 * acquired and safetly released when the services are done being utilized.
 *
 * Because of their excellent composition properties, layers are the idiomatic
 * way in ZIO to create services that depend on other services.
